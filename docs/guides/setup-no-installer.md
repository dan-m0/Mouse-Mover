If you do not wish to run the installers, please follow the below steps

PLEASE NOTE:

    I will **NOT** provide further support with this process - I have created installers to automatically do this for users, which are intentinoally designed to bypass any group policy restrictions. Your choice not to run them is not my problem. **ANY** issues raised asking for help this process will be closed!

1. Install Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open a terminal
    2.1. In MacOS, this is called Terminal in Launchpad
    2.2. In Windows, press Windows key+R, type "powershell" and press enter
3. Paste this and press enter: python3 -m pip install pyautogui
    3.1. In some cases, you will need to use this instead: python -m pip install pyautogui
4. Once complete, you can run the file mouse_mover.py from wherever it is saved
